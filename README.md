Point72 Stock Pitch Competition

As a member of MII's 2017 Management Team, I pitched Etsy as a long alongside 3 Institute members for MII's inaugural Point72 Stock Pitch Competition.

As a component of the pitch, data analysis was conducted on Etsy transaction data (datasets are non-public). This repository contains R code for geographic visualization and Twitter mapping, and generated visuals are included in PNG and ZIP format.
